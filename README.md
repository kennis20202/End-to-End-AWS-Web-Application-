**Project Title: End-to-End AWS Web Application Deployment Guide**

![Image](End to End Architecture.png)

**Introduction:**
This guide outlines the step-by-step process of architecting and deploying a web application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using various services such as AWS Amplify, AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM). The project involves creating a fully functional web application leveraging these AWS services.

**Architecture Overview:**
The architecture of the web application is as follows:
1. **Frontend Hosting:** AWS Amplify is used to host the frontend of the web application. This includes static web assets such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
2. **Backend Services:**
   - **AWS Lambda:** Serverless functions are deployed using AWS Lambda to handle backend logic and business logic of the application.
   - **Amazon API Gateway:** API Gateway acts as a gateway for HTTP requests to Lambda functions, enabling communication between the frontend and backend of the application.
   - **Amazon DynamoDB:** DynamoDB serves as the NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data required by the application.
3. **Access Management:** AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM) is used to manage access to AWS resources securely.

**Deployment Steps:**
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the GitHub repository containing the reference diagrams and deployment scripts for the project.

2. **Set up AWS Amplify:**
   - Create an AWS Amplify project.
   - Configure the project settings and choose the appropriate frontend framework.
   - Add the necessary frontend files to the project directory.
   - Push the changes to the Amplify project repository to trigger the deployment of frontend assets.

3. **Configure AWS Lambda Functions:**
   - Write serverless functions to handle backend logic.
   - Deploy the Lambda functions using AWS Lambda service.
   - Configure the functions to integrate with API Gateway for HTTP triggers.

4. **Set up Amazon API Gateway:**
   - Create a new API in API Gateway.
   - Define the necessary endpoints and methods for the API.
   - Configure the endpoints to trigger the corresponding Lambda functions.

5. **Create Amazon DynamoDB Tables:**
   - Design the database schema for DynamoDB tables.
   - Create the required tables using the DynamoDB console or AWS SDK.

6. **Configure IAM Roles and Policies:**
   - Create IAM roles with appropriate permissions for Lambda functions, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.
   - Attach policies to the roles to grant necessary permissions for accessing AWS resources.

7. **Test the Application:**
   - Test the frontend and backend functionality of the application.
   - Verify that data is being stored and retrieved correctly from DynamoDB.
   - Ensure that the IAM roles provide the necessary access permissions.

**Conclusion:**
This guide provides a comprehensive overview of deploying a web application on AWS using services like AWS Amplify, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and IAM. By following the outlined steps, developers can successfully architect and deploy end-to-end web applications on AWS infrastructure.
